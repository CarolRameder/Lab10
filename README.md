compulosry

I solved the compulsory part. 
There are 2 projects, one for the client and one for the server . 
They communicate with each other using a hardcoded port and sockets . 
The client can transmit commands to the  server and receives answers back, in form of strings . 
More about the functionality and code can be seen in the attached video and comments .
